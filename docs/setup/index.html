<h1>DH Lab Setup, v. 1.1</h1>
<p>Setting up a development environment on a computer unfortunately remains a complicated task,
even in 2018. After the first group meetings on Friday, September 14, we went back to our
instructions and tried to overhaul them to make them easier. You're right now looking at the
result of that effort.</p>
<p>This guide includes a complete installation of Python, git, and PyCharm on your computer.
Many of you have already complete some of these steps. Hence, if you are certain or almost certain
that you have already completed one of the listed steps, you can move to the next one.</p>
<p>Here's a brief list of the changes, compared to the guides from Friday:</p>
<ul>
<li>No use of the command line</li>
<li>Use of the graphical Python installer from python.org</li>
<li>Setup of the virtual environment is done by PyCharm</li>
</ul>
<p>We hope this will make it easier for your to setup your Python enviroment.</p>
<h2>1. Install Python</h2>
<p>Note: You can skip this step if: 1) You already have Python 3.6 or Python 3.7 installed and 2)
you know where you have it installed. In all other cases, it will be easier to install Python 3.7
even if it is a re-install.</p>
<p>Go to the
<a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">python.org website</a> and download the Python 3.7 installer.</p>
<p><img src="../images/python_org_1.png" alt="">
Once you have downloaded the installer, double-click it to start the installation.</p>
<p><strong>Note: All of the following screenshots are from the Mac installation. Windows may present you
with different menus and we'll add screenshots for that install soon. In the meantime, just
select the option that seems like the default--it shouldn't be too hard.</strong></p>
<p><img src="../images/python_org_2.png" alt="">

<img src="../images/python_org_4.png" alt="">
Agree to the pop-up.
<img src="../images/python_org_5.png" alt=""></p>
<p>We suggest that you install Python in the default location. If you select another location, please
note that location down--we will probably need it for bug-fixing later.
<img src="../images/python_org_6.png" alt="">
Once you're done with the installation (at least on Macs), you will be left with this directory.
This means that everything installed correctly and you're ready for the next step.

<h1>2. Installing and Setting Up Git</h1>
<p>We will use Git to work together on our shared codebase. Git is version-control open-source software
that allows us to work on code individually while we test, document, and prepare new functions and
features. Once we are ready to share the new additions to the larger project, we can open a pull
request to receive feedback and modify our code until it is accepted and incorporated into the
larger project's codebase.</p>
<p>GitHub is a popular code repository web-based hosting service web-based hosting service that uses
Git to help developers collaborate on code. It offers a desktop program to help make Git more
intuitive.</p>
<p>This guide will set you up with Git and GitHub on a Windows or Mac machine.</p>
<h4>2.1 Create a GitHub Account</h4>
<p>Next, you should create a <a href="https://github.com/join">GitHub account</a>if you don't already have one.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that you can get added benefits through GitHub and other technology organizations
— including unlimited private code repos — by signing up for
the <a href="https://education.github.com/pack">Student Developer Pack.</a></p>
<h4>2.2 Fork Repository</h4>
<p>Forking a repository allows us to work on the project individually without interfering with
someone else's work. Each individual team member should create their own fork of the main project.</p>
<p>To do this, choose the relevant repository of <a href="https://github.com/dhmit">MIT DH</a>.</p>
<p>From the repository you're working with, you can create your own fork of the main project. To do
this, you have to log in to your Github account and go to the main project page. For example, for
the <code>gender_novels</code> project, the main project page is
<a href="https://github.com/dhmit/gender_novels">https://github.com/dhmit/gender_novels</a>. From this page,
you should look for the <strong>Fork</strong> button on the right side near the top.</p>
<p><img src="../images/setup_fork_1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Once the main repository is forked, you should be on a page that looks almost like the original
repository except that it doesn't belong to the <strong>dhmit</strong> account but rather to your own account
(in this case: <strong>dhlab-test</strong>).</p>
<p><img src="../images/setup_fork_2.png" alt=""></p>
<p>With your repository forked, you can move on to installing the GitHub desktop application.</p>
<h4>2.3 Install GitHub Desktop</h4>
<p><a href="https://desktop.github.com/">Github Desktop</a> provides you with a graphical user interface (GUI)
to work with git and GitHub. This provides you with a visual review of your changes before you push
code.</p>
<p>You can download Github Desktop from <a href="https://desktop.github.com/">https://desktop.github.com/</a>.
Install the appropriate version for your machine and follow the installation steps.</p>
<h4>2.4 Create a Local Copy of the Repository</h4>
<p>Once you have installed and opened Github Desktop, you will be greeted by a loading screen. To
download a local copy of the repository that you just forked, click on <strong>Clone a Repository</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="../images/setup_gitdesktop_1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>If you aren't already logged in to your GitHub account, you should sign in now.</p>
<p><img src="../images/setup_gitdesktop_2.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Signing in will connect GitHub Desktop to your GitHub account.</p>
<p>If you logged in at this point, you may be dropped back on the loading screen — click
on <strong>Clone a Repository</strong> again.</p>
<p>You should now see the forked repository pop up under <strong>Your Repositories</strong>. Once you click on it,
you can select the local path where you want all the project files to be stored.</p>
<p>You may have a path similar to the following:</p>
<pre><code>/Users/your-name/GitHub/repo-name
</code></pre>
<p>Note the path, as you will need to know it later.</p>
<p>Once the path is set, press <strong>Clone</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="../images/setup_gitdesktop_3.png" alt=""></p>
<p>If you go to the specified path, you should now see all of the project files there.</p>
<p><img src="../images/setup_gitdesktop_4.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Finally, install the git command line interface. This allows you to execute git commands from
the command line if necessary.
<strong>Note: The menu may look slightly different in Windows.</strong>
<img src="../images/setup_gitdesktop_5.png" alt="">
You should see a confirmation that the installation has succeeded.
<img src="../images/setup_gitdesktop_6.png" alt=""></p>
<p>With this step, you should have your git and Github environment configured.</p>
<h2>3. Install and Setup PyCharm</h2>
<p>In the Digital Humanities Lab, we'll be using the PyCharm IDE from JetBrains.</p>
<p>An IDE or <strong>I</strong>ntegrated <strong>D</strong>evelopment <strong>E</strong>nvironment gives you the ability to write, run, test,
and lint code all in one place. The PyCharm interface looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="../images/pycharm_1.png" alt="PyCharm IDE interface"></p>
<p>By standardizing the IDE across the lab, we hope to facilitate collaboration and standardize
support.</p>
<h4>PyCharm Installation</h4>
<p>As students with a <code>.edu</code> email address, you can get PyCharm for free
by <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/student/">signing up for an educational account</a>.</p>
<p>Once you have signed up for an account, you will receive an email activation to confirm your email.
When you click on the link you will be able to download PyCharm among other JetBrains offerings.</p>
<p><img src="../images/pycharm_2.png" alt="JetBrains Student Installation Page"></p>
<p>Alternately you can download PyCharm through this
<a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/">direct link</a> — be sure to get the Professional Edition.</p>
<p><img src="../images/pycharm_3.png" alt="PyCharm Installation"></p>
<p>The installation process differs slightly between Mac and Windows but you can select the default
settings in both cases.</p>
<h2>Initialization</h2>
<p>Once the installation process is finished, open up the PyCharm application. This
will open up an activation screen. You can activate PyCharm by entering the email
and password that you used before to sign up for a Jetbrains account.</p>
<p><img src="../images/pycharm_activation_1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Next, you will get to a setup menu.</p>
<p><strong>Note: If you already have PyCharm installed or you accidentally skipped this setup, don't worry.
You can change the settings later--they are not very important.</strong></p>
<p>In the first window, select &quot;Do not import settings&quot;. We'll import settings at a
later stage.
<img src="../images/pycharm_init_1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>(Mac only)
Select the Mac OS X 10.5+ keymap</p>
<p><img src="../images/pycharm_init_2.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Select either the dark (&quot;Darcula&quot;) or Light theme. (Note: you might have
to set it again later after you import )
<img src="../images/pycharm_init_3.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Don't create a launcher script--leave the checkbox empty.
<img src="../images/pycharm_init_4.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Click on the buttons to install Markdown and BashSupport.
<img src="../images/pycharm_init_5.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Once the setup is finished, you will be greeted by the screen below. Select &quot;Open&quot;
to select the existing gender_novels repo.
<img src="../images/pycharm_init_6.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Select the path to your gender_novels repo (in my case: ~/code/gender_novels)
<img src="../images/pycharm_init_7.png" alt=""></p>
<p>This will bring up the main PyCharm window with the loaded gender_novels directory
on the left.
<img src="../images/pycharm_config_1.png" alt=""></p>
<h2>Configuration</h2>
<p>Next, we're going to import the DH Lab PyCharm settings. First
<a href="https://github.com/dhmit/gender_novels/raw/master/gender_novels/tutorials/setup/pycharm_settings.jar">download the settings file.</a>
Then, go to file, &quot;Import Settings...&quot;
<img src="../images/pycharm_config_2.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Import all components.
<img src="../images/pycharm_config_3.png" alt=""></p>
<p>As a final step, we'll change some configuration settings.</p>
<p>On Mac, select PyCharm -&gt; Preferences, On Windows File -&gt; Settings
<img src="../images/pycharm_config_4.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Under &quot;Appearance &amp; Behavior&quot; -&gt; Appearance, you can select either the dark
&quot;Darcula&quot; theme or the &quot;Light&quot; theme.
<img src="../images/pycharm_config_5.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Then, you need to configure your Python interpreter under &quot;Project: gender_novels&quot;
-&gt; Project Interpreter. Click on the wheel in the top right and select &quot;Add&quot;.
<img src="../images/pycharm_config_6.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Select &quot;New environment.&quot; Under &quot;Base Interpreter&quot; look for one that ends with
Python 3.7 and click OK.</p>
<p><strong>Note 1: If you cannot find a Python 3.6 or 3.7 interpreter in the &quot;Base Interpreter&quot; list,
something probably went wrong with the Python installation. Try restarting your computer.
If that doesn't fix the problem, come see us--we'll probably need to track down the
path to your Python installation.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Note2: If you get a warning saying that &quot;Environment location is not empty&quot; you most
likely have already created a virtual environment for this project. You can either try
to skip this step or initialize a new environment by replacing (in &quot;Location&quot;) <code>venv</code>
with <code>gender_env</code></strong>
<img src="../images/pycharm_config_6a.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Back in the main menu, click &quot;Apply&quot; to activate the updated settings.
<img src="../images/pycharm_config_9.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Now, we only need to locally install the gender_novels package and its dependencies to
finish the installation.</p>
<p>First, open setup.py by double-clicking on it.
<img src="../images/pycharm_env_1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Next, go to &quot;Tools&quot; -&gt; &quot;Run setup.py Task...&quot;
<strong>Note: If you cannot see &quot;Run setup.py Task&quot; in the menu, you might have the wrong
or no file open. In particular, you might have a file from the venv folder (in orange)
open. Try opening setup.py or common.py or other python files in the directory until
you see the option &quot;Run setup.py Task&quot;.</strong>
<img src="../images/pycharm_env_2.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Either double-click on &quot;develop&quot; or type &quot;develop&quot; into the task name window and hit
Enter.
<img src="../images/pycharm_env_1a.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Leave the following window empty and just click &quot;OK.&quot;
<img src="../images/pycharm_env_3.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Finally, we will run a test to see if the installation succeeded. To do this, go to
&quot;Tools&quot; -&gt; &quot;Run setup.py Task&quot; again.
<img src="../images/pycharm_env_2.png" alt=""></p>
<p>This time around, select &quot;test&quot;.
<img src="../images/pycharm_env_4.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Leave the following window empty and just click &quot;OK.&quot;
<img src="../images/pycharm_env_3.png" alt=""></p>
<p>When the command has finished, you should see a prompt similar to the one below, which
says:</p>
<pre><code>Ran &lt;x&gt; tests in &lt;y&gt;s 

OK
</code></pre>
<p><img src="../images/pycharm_env_5.png" alt=""></p>
<p>If you see this, you're all set to start working on this DH Lab project!</p>
