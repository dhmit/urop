<h1>Git Tutorial</h1>
<p>This tutorial presupposes that you have set up git, Github, and Github
Desktop as described in the
<a href="https://github.com/dhmit/gender_novels/blob/devbranch/tutorials/setup.md">setup tutorial.</a></p>
<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>Git is a wonderful for collaborative coding work. It allows all of us to work on the same
codebase and combine the changes that we make. The problem with git is that it is too powerful
and gives you too many options and comes with a vocabulary of its own, filled with pushes, pulls,
merges, and branches.</p>
<p><img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/git.png" alt=""></p>
<p>This tutorial isn't a deep dive into the curious world of git. What it covers are only the
essential parts that you need to know to work in the DH Lab. To make your and our life easier we
also won't cover git's command line interface and only look at the Github Desktop GUI (It's
generally easier to make mistakes with a command line because the GUI will usually ask you
multiple times if you are sure that you want to delete your work.)</p>
<h4>General Outline: Local, Remote, and Upstream</h4>
<p>In every project, we will work with three different versions of the same repository. You have
already worked with all of them during the setup process.</p>
<p><img src="images/git/git_init_1.png" alt="">
First, there is the
<a href="https://github.com/dhmit/gender_novels">master repository</a>
on Github. It contains the authoritative current version of our project. It is also the
repository that we all contribute our documented and tested code to.</p>
<p><img src="images/git/git_init_2.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Second, there is your personal fork of the project on Github. When you set it up, this fork was
an exact copy of the upstream master repo. However, the fork is created, this repo is under your
control and you can use it to stage changes before submitting them to the upstream master.</p>
<p><img src="images/git/git_init_3.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Third, there is the clone of the project on your local computer. This is the version that you'll
actually be working with. Again, this local repository starts out as an exact copy of your remote
fork.</p>
<p>As soon as you start working on the code on your local machine, you are changing files but your
local repository doesn't change yet. Git tracks the changes that you make to the repository files
but it doesn't store them in the repository itself until you explicitly save them (called
&quot;commit&quot;) to your local repository. The advantage of this process is that it makes it easy to
reset to an earlier state if you make a mistake.</p>
<h2>Workflow: Code Commits, Pushes and Pull Requests</h2>
<p>When you work with git, your code moves from work in progress to your
Github fork and finally to the main upstream repo.</p>
<h3>Workflow: A Schematic Overview</h3>
<p>Here's a schematic overview of how this works.</p>
<p><img src="images/git/git_workflow_1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>First, you fetch and merge any updates from the upstream master.
<img src="images/git/git_workflow_2.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Then, you are ready to implement a new idea, write tests and documentation, and finally the
necessary code.</p>
<p>Note: These changes are saved on your local machine but they are not yet saved in your local
git repository.
<img src="images/git/git_workflow_3.png" alt=""></p>
<p>When you are ready to share your work with the whole lab, you should first fetch and merge<br>
updates from the upstream master--someone might have been working on the same file as you did.
<img src="images/git/git_workflow_4.png" alt=""></p>
<p>This combines any potential upstream changes with your local changes.
<img src="images/git/git_workflow_5.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Now, you're ready to save your work to your local repository, which is called a &quot;commit.&quot; You can
think of a commit as a save point in a video-game--if you make mistakes in the future, you can
reset to this save point.
<img src="images/git/git_workflow_6.png" alt=""></p>
<p>So far, you have only saved your changes to your local machine. Next, you want to save your
changes to your changes on your github fork. This is called a &quot;push.&quot; You &quot;push&quot; your changes to
your fork.
<img src="images/git/git_workflow_7.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Finally, to share your changes with the whole lab, you initialize a &quot;pull request.&quot; This is a
request that your code gets reviewed and, if suitable, incorporated in the main repository.
<img src="images/git/git_workflow_8.png" alt=""></p>
<p>A &quot;pull request&quot; is different from a &quot;push.&quot; When you push your code, the fork automatically
takes on the state of your local repository. In contrast, when you submit a pull request, you
are asking that your changes get incorporated into the upstream master repository. However, the
changes won't appear in the upstream master until it passes the tests of our continuous
integration system and a staff member or the quality assurance specialist has reviewed and
approved them.

<h3>The Workflow in Practice--Which Buttons Do I Press?</h3>
<h4>Fetch and Merge Updates</h4>
<p>First, fetch and merge all of the updates from the upstream master.</p>
<p>&quot;Fetch&quot; gathers all of the updates from the upstream master.</p>
<p>&quot;Merge&quot; combines the code in your local repository with the code from the upstream master.</p>
<p><img src="images/git/git_workflow_practice_1.png" alt=""></p>
<h4>Write Documentation, Code, Tutorials...</h4>
<p>You are now ready to write new code or, as I am doing right now, new tutorials for other lab
members. As soon as you make changes to your files, they will also show up in Github Desktop.
<img src="images/git/git_workflow_practice_2.png" alt=""></p>
<h4>Commit Changes</h4>
<p>Once you are done with your changes, you should save your work by &quot;committing&quot; it to your local
repository.</p>
<p>First, you should fetch and merge updates from the upstream master again. It's possible that
someone else made modifications to the same files as you did and you want to have those changes
before you commit your own changes. (See the screenshots above.)</p>
<p>Here's how you commit code to your local repository.
<img src="images/git/git_workflow_practice_3.png" alt=""></p>
<h4>Push Changes to Your Github Fork</h4>
<p>You can now &quot;push&quot; your changes to your fork on Github by clicking &quot;Push origin&quot; in Github.
<img src="images/git/git_workflow_practice_4.png" alt=""></p>
<h4>Open a Pull Request</h4>
<p>If you want share your code with the rest of the lab, you need to issue a &quot;pull request.&quot;</p>
<p>Remember this difference: You own your own fork on Github (<Github username>/gender_novels), which
means that you can just &quot;push&quot; your code there, overwriting any earlier state. However, you don't
own the upstream master (dhmit/gender_novels). To make changes to the upstream master, you need
to request that your code gets incorporated in that repository. Here's how that process works.
<img src="images/git/git_workflow_practice_5.png" alt=""></p>
<p>When you have submitted a pull request, one of the staff members or the quality assurance
specialist will review your pull request. Expect that we will often ask for further modifications
before merging your changes into the upstream master.</p>
<h2>Troubeshooting</h2>
<h3>Merge Conflicts</h3>
<p>Git is great because it allows multiple people to work together on the same piece of
software--until it gets confused about how to merge different copies of the same file. Welcome to
the &quot;merge conflict.&quot;</p>
<p>A merge conflict happens when git can't merge two copies of the same file.</p>
<p>For example, the fourth line of my test.py may read as</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">a = 10
</code></pre>
<p>On the upstream master, that same line in test.py may be</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">a = 11
</code></pre>
<p>When trying to merge these two files, git will throw up its arms in the air and give you an error
message that looks like this:
<img src="images/git/git_merge_1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Generally, what you want to do in those cases is to revert your local changes. As a general rule,
the upstream master is always right and you need to fix this conflict on your machine.</p>
<p>The easiest way of fixing this merge error is to right-click on the offending file (in this case:
sample_novels.csv) and select &quot;Discard Changes.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: If you want to keep some of the changes that you made to the file that causes the
merge conflict, one option is to copy and past those changes to scratch.py, discard changes to
the file, merge the changes from upstream master, and copy and paste the changes from scratch.py
back into the original file.</p>
<p><strong>Caution</strong>: Don't select &quot;Discard All Changes...&quot;--unless you want to delete all of your changes
to all files since the last commit.
<img src="images/git/git_merge_2.png" alt=""></p>
<h3>Commit Mistakes</h3>
<p>What to do if you have committed something by mistake?</p>
<p>If the difference is just one or two lines, the easiest solution is to just revert those changes
by hand and commit them--voila.</p>
<p>If the changes were more substantial and/or you have messed up your local repo more generally,
here's a procedure you can use to reset your local repository or your Github fork to the latest
stage of the upstream master.</p>
<p><strong>Caution. There's a high likelihood that you will delete a lot of your own work with these
commands.</strong></p>
<p>To reset your local repository to the last stage of the upstream master, open a terminal (Mac) or
Powershell (Windows), navigate to the the base gender_novels path. There, you can enter the
following command. <strong>Again, if you're not sure if you're doing this the right way, come see us.</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-terminal">git reset --hard upstream/master
</code></pre>
<p>If you have already pushed your changes to your Github fork, you also need to run the following
command to reset your fork:</p>
<pre><code class="language-terminal">git push --force origin master
</code></pre>
