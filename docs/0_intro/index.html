<h1>Installing DH Lab Tools</h1>
<p>This document will walk you through the process of setting up the tools that we use in the DH Lab to do our work.</p>
<h2>Preliminary notes</h2>
<p>We support macOS, Windows, or Ubuntu 18.04. We do not permit lab work to be done on other operating systems because if you need help, we can't help you on any other platform. (Looking at you, l33t h4xx0r &quot;I only use Slackware without a GUI&quot;)</p>
<p>There are a lot of perfectly good ways to write code. We're going to ask you to use a certain very specific set of tools. This is so that if something goes wrong, we can help, and so that you can help each other as you gain mastery of these tools.</p>
<p>For many of you, this might be your first experience writing software on a large team: this requires a set of tools and practices to allow us to work towards a common goal without stepping on each others toes, accidentally clobbering our colleages' contributions, and making sure we're all moving in the same direction.</p>
<h2>Communication</h2>
<ol>
<li>GitHub:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>If you do not already have an account, create one. Ideally choose a username that makes it easy for us to identify you -- and remember that your GitHub account is going to be a part of your professional identity.</li>
<li>Email Ryaan <a href="mailto:rahmed@mit.edu">rahmed@mit.edu</a> with your username, so he can add you to our organization.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Join Slack, and join the mitdhlab workspace.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Install a plain text editor</h2>
<p>We will be doing most of our work within an IDE (PyCharm), but it will occasionally be useful to have a plaintext editor available. Please install Sublime Text https://www.sublimetext.com/</p>
<h2>Install Git</h2>
<h2>macOS</h2>
<h2>Install GitHub Desktop</h2>
<h2>Install Python</h2>
<h2>Install PyCharm</h2>
<h2>Install npm</h2>
<p>https://nodejs.org/
Choose the LTS (long term support) version, not the Current version.</p>
<h2>Windows users</h2>
<p>You'll need to install Git for Windows, which comes with Bash for Windows.</p>
<p>On this screen, pick Sublime Text as your default editor for Git.</p>
