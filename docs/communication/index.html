<p>Communication comes first because without it, we can't get anything done.</p>

<p>There are three separate places on this page where it says to <a href="mailto:digitalhumanities@mit.edu">email Sophie</a> with some information. Please read to the bottom, aggregate everything, and then send them one email with all the information that we're missing from you in one go.</p>

<h2>GitHub</h2>
<p>
If you do not already have a GitHub account, <a href="https://github.com/join">create one</a>. Ideally choose a username that makes it easy for others to identify you, and remember that your GitHub account is going to be a part of your professional identity for a long time, so choose wisely.
</p>
<p>
If you provided a GitHub username or link in your UROP application, you should have already received an invitation to join our GitHub organization. Please accept this invite now, if you haven't already.
</p>
<p>
If you haven't received an invite, or didn't previously have an account, email Sophie with your username, so she can add you to <a href="https://github.com/dhmit/">our organization</a>.</p>
<p>
Even if you already have a GitHub account, you may wish to sign up for the <a href="https://education.github.com/pack">Student Developer Pack.</a>
</p>

<h2>Slack</h2>
<p>
You should have already received an invitation to join the DH Lab Slack workspace.
</p>
<p>
Once you've joined the workspace, send a message on the #random channel, with the title of your favorite book, piece of music, or visual art, so everyone knows how to reach you there.
</p>


<h2>Google Account</h2>
<p>
We use Google Drive and Google Docs extensively in the lab to collaboratively edit documents. Please email Sophie your Google Account username, so we can add you to the DH Lab shared Google Drive folder. We recommend that you request an <a href="https://ist.mit.edu/g-suite" target="_blank">MIT G Suite for Education account</a> and use that for your labwork, such that it's associated with your kerberos ID.
</p>



<h2>Email</h2>
<p>As stated in in the <a href="/contract">UROP Contract</a>, we expect you to check your email once per business day and expect that you will respond to messages in a timely manner.</p>
<p>Please email Sophie with a headshot photo so we can put it on the website.</p>
