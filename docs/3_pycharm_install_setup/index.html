<h1>PyCharm Installation and Setup</h1>
<p>In the Digital Humanities Lab, we'll be using the PyCharm IDE from JetBrains.</p>
<p>An IDE or <strong>I</strong>ntegrated <strong>D</strong>evelopment <strong>E</strong>nvironment gives you the ability to write, run, test, and lint code all in one place. The PyCharm interface looks like this:</p>

<p>By standardizing the IDE across the lab, we hope to facilitate collaboration and standardize support. This tutorial will walk you through installation and setup of PyCharm.</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>As students with a <code>.edu</code> email address, you can get PyCharm for free by <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/student/">signing up for an educational account</a>.</p>
<p>Once you have signed up for an account, you will receive an email activation to confirm your email. When you click on the link you will be able to download PyCharm among other JetBrains offerings.</p>
<p><img src="../images/pycharm_2.png" alt="JetBrains Student Installation Page"></p>
<p>Alternately you can download PyCharm through this <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/">direct link</a> â€” be sure to get the Professional Edition.</p>

<p>The installation process differs slightly between Mac and Windows but you can select the default settings in both cases.</p>
<h2>Initialization</h2>
<p>Once the installation process is finished, open up the PyCharm application. This
will open up an activation screen. You can activate PyCharm by entering the email
and password that you used before to sign up for a Jetbrains account.

later stage.

<p>This will bring up the main PyCharm window with the loaded gender_novels directory
on the left.

<h2>Configuration</h2>
<p>Next, we're going to import the DH Lab PyCharm settings. First
<a href="https://github.com/dhmit/gender_novels/raw/master/gender_novels/tutorials/setup/pycharm_settings.jar">download the settings file.</a>
Then, go to file, &quot;Import Settings...&quot;
<img src="../images/pycharm_config_2.png" alt=""></p>

First, you need to navigate to the directory of the gender_novels Python
environment that you had set up in the &quot;Install Python 3&quot; tutorial. From
there, you select the python executable in the bin folder. So the full path is
<code>&lt;environment_directory&gt;/bin/python</code>.
