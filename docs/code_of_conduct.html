<p>As contributors and maintainers of the projects of the Lab of the MIT/SHASS Programs in Digital Humanities, we will foster an open and welcoming environment of intersectional inclusion. In doing so, we pledge to make participation in our project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size or shape, disability, ethnicity, gender identity or expression, level of experience, mental health status, nationality, neurodiversity, personal appearance, race, religion, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, veteran status.</p>
<h2>Creating an Open and Welcoming Environment</h2>
<p>In order to foster an inclusive and positive space, behavior and language among contributors, users, and maintainers should be respectful and friendly in nature. Some guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use inclusive language</li>
<li>Refrain from generalizing or stereotyping</li>
<li>Opt for gender-neutral language in documentation and conversation (e.g. avoid "guys" and other gendered words)</li>
<li>Be respectful of differing viewpoints and acknowledge that we all have diverse experiences</li>
<li>Accept and give feedback gracefully</li>
<li>Show empathy towards others</li>
</ul>
<p>All Digital Humanities Lab spaces are meant for professional interactions, and any behavior which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting is unacceptable.</p>
<h2>Responsibilities of Maintainers</h2>
<p>Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.</p>
<p>Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.</p>
<h2>Scope</h2>
<p>This Code of Conduct applies to all content on the Digital Humanities Lab's GitHub organization, or any other official Digital Humanities Lab web presence allowing for community interactions, as well as at all official events, whether offline or online.</p>
<p>The Code of Conduct also applies within project spaces and in public spaces whenever an individual is representing the Digital Humanities Lab or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed or de facto representative at an online or offline event.</p>
<h2>Attribution</h2>
<p>This Code of Conduct is inspired by the <a href="https://www.contributor-covenant.org/">Contributor Covenant</a>, the <a href="https://geekfeminism.org/about/code-of-conduct/">Geek Feminism Code of Conduct</a> and the <a href="https://www.drupal.org/dcoc">Drupal Code of Conduct</a>.</p>
