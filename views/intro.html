<p>This guide will walk you through the process of setting up the tools that we use in the DH Lab to do our work.</p>

<p>
This might be your first experience writing software on a large team, which requires a set of practices to allow us to work towards a common goal without stepping on each others toes.

By the end of this guide, you should be ready to contribute code to our shared project, to create issues in our shared bug tracker, and to communicate with other members on the team.
</p>

<p>There are a lot of tools available to help you write and maintain code. We're going to ask you to use a specific set of tools for all of your labwork. This is so that if something goes wrong, we can help, and so that you can help each other as you gain mastery of these tools.</p>

<h2>Operating System</h2>
<p>
We support macOS 11, 12, and 13 (i.e., Big Sur, Monterey, and Ventura), Windows 10 and 11, and Ubuntu 20.04 and 22.04.</p>

<p>
If you're on some other Linux distro, we hope you know what you're doing, and we wish you good luck. (Okay, seriously: if you're on some niche Linux we haven't heard of, it's going to be hard for us to support you, but we will try.)
</p>

<p>
Please go through the whole guide and make sure you're up-to-date with (particularly) the version of Python we'll be using this semester.
