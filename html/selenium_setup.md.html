<h5>Setting up Selenium testing locally</h5>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Make sure you've installed the latest version of the Python requirements, including selenium, by navigating to requirements.txt in PyCharm. If you're missing anything, it should prompt you to install the missing requirements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You'll need to install ChromeDriver, which is a tool for automated testing in Chrome.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>macOS: The easiest thing to do is to install chromedriver using the Homebrew package manager. Go to the <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew website</a> and follow the directions for installing Homebrew. Then, run the command brew cask install chromedriver to install ChromeDriver and add it to your PATH.</p>
<p>Windows 10: you'll need to download and add ChromeDriver to your PATH manually.</p>
<p>Create a directory C:\bin</p>
<p><a href="https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/79.0.3945.36/chromedriver_win32.zip">Download chromedriver for Chrome 79 for Windows</a>, unzip it, and save the exe to C:\bin</p>
<p>Open the Control Panel, search for 'environment variables', and click 'Edit the system environment variables'.</p>
<p>On the System Properties window, click 'Environment Variables...'</p>
<p>Under 'System variables' select 'Path' and click 'Edit...'</p>
<p>Add the C:\bin directory to your path by clicking New and adding a new entry to the list.</p>
<p>Once you've installed ChromeDriver, verify it's working by restarting PyCharm and, from the backend directory, running python manage.py test.</p>
