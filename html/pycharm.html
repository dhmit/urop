<h1>PyCharm Installation and Setup</h1>
<p>In the Digital Humanities Lab, we'll be using the PyCharm IDE from JetBrains.</p>
<p>An IDE (or, Integrated Development Environment) gives you the ability to write, run, test, and lint code all in one place. The PyCharm interface looks like this:</p>
<p><img alt="PyCharm IDE interface" src="./images/pycharm_1.png" /></p>
<p>By standardizing the IDE across the lab, we hope to facilitate collaboration and standardize support. This tutorial will walk you through installation and setup of PyCharm.</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>As students with a <code>.edu</code> email address, you can get PyCharm for free by <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/student/">signing up for an educational account</a>.</p>
<p>Once you have signed up for an account, you will receive an email activation to confirm your email. When you click on the link you will be able to download PyCharm among other JetBrains offerings.</p>

<p>Alternately you can download PyCharm through this <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/">direct link</a> â€” be sure to get the Professional Edition.</p>

<p>The installation process differs slightly between Mac and Windows but you can select the default settings in both cases.</p>
<h2>Initialization</h2>
<p>In the first window, select "Do not import settings". We'll import settings at a
later stage.

<p>(Mac only)
Select the Mac OS X 10.5+ keymap</p>
<p><img alt="" src="./images/pycharm_init_2.png" /></p>
<p>Select either the dark ("Darcula") or Light theme. (Note: you might have
to set it again later after you import )

<p>Don't create a launcher script--leave the checkbox empty.

<p>Click on the buttons to install Markdown and BashSupport, if you see them.

<p>Once the installation process is finished, PyCharm
will open an activation screen. You can activate PyCharm by entering the email
and password that you used before to sign up for a Jetbrains account.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="./images/pycharm_activation_1.png" /></p>
<p>Once the setup is finished, you will be greeted by the screen below. Select "Open"
to select the existing prompted_readings repo.
<img alt="" src="./images/pycharm_init_6.png" /></p>
<p>Select the path to your prompted_readings repo. This will bring up the main PyCharm window with the loaded prompted_readings directory
on the left.</p>
<h2>Configuration</h2>
<p>As a final step, we'll change some configuration settings.</p>
<p>On a Mac, select <code>PyCharm -&gt; Preferences</code>; On Windows, <code>File -&gt; Settings</code>
<img alt="" src="./images/pycharm_config_4.png" /></p>
<p>Under "Appearance &amp; Behavior" -&gt; Appearance, you can select either the dark
"Darcula" theme or the "Light" theme.
<img alt="" src="./images/pycharm_config_5.png" /></p>
<p>Then, you need to configure your Python interpreter under "Project: prompted_readings"
-&gt; Project Interpreter. Click on the wheel in the top right and select "Add".
<img alt="" src="./images/pycharm_config_6.png" /></p>
<p>Select "New Environment" and make sure that you are using a base interpreter that is Python 3.6 or higher.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="./images/new_venv.png" /></p>
<p>Leave the location for the interpreter as the default provided by PyCharm.</p>
<p>After this is configured and you've hit <code>OK</code>, you will see the project interpreter screen again. Once this is finished, press <code>Apply</code> to save your changes, and then click <code>OK</code> to finish.</p>
<p>You have now completed the PyCharm installation and configuration.</p>
