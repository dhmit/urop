META:
- setup technical office hours for help with setup
- survey incoming students for their hardware

Communicating:
- Slack
- Email

Things to still figure out:
- sequencing: what order to do all of these things

Priorities:
- Keeping things GUI as much as possible

Python installation
- Python 3.7 only
- make sure everyone has a standard installation using the Python GUI installer
	- it installs to Library/Frameworks, which is fine for now...
	- NO ANACONDA NO ANACONDA NO ANACONDA
	- NO macOS system Python (bc it's 2.7)
	- NO macOS homebrew Python
- PyCharm to manage virtual environments
- What happens if you install PyCharm on a Windows laptop that doesn't have Python installed already?

NPM installation
- use the GUI if possible
	- find out where this installs the thing
- manual for npm install

PyCharm
- installing PyCharm
- renewing PyCharm subscription
- getting a project integrated with venv etc.


Git clients and installation
- Install Atom
- Here's where the plug in
- Here's how Git works (this is a link)
- Atom GitHub to replace GitHub desktop

GitHub protocol
- explain feature branches
- explain PRs
- explain collaboration on feature branches
- staying in sync with master

Windows-only issues
- Having a system Git at all
- Windows students need to install Bash for Windows
- Get Bash for Windows integrated into PyCharm
- having a reasonable cmd line interface at all

Configs / code quality
- ESLint config
- Pylint config
- standard (?) Travis config
- standard .gitignore
- Getting ESLint and Pylint integrated
- basic editor config (see Gender Novels for an example)
