<p>In the Digital Humanities Lab, we'll be using the PyCharm IDE from JetBrains. An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is a tool that allows you to write, run, test, debug, and lint code all in one place. By standardizing the IDE across the lab, we hope to facilitate collaboration and standardize support. This tutorial will walk you through installation and setup of PyCharm.</p>

<p>
<em>Returning UROPs</em>: Please ensure that you are on the latest version of PyCharm (2020.2.1). If the last time you installed PyCharm was this time last year, please follow the directions below to install the latest version. Please also note that you have to periodically renew your educational account. When you install the new version of PyCharm, it will first uninstall your existing version. If you have any custom settings (e.g., editor settings, etc.) make sure you pay attention to the checkboxes about not deleting those settings.

<h5>Installation</h5>
<p>As students with a <code>.edu</code> email address, you can get PyCharm for free by <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/student/">signing up for an educational account</a>.</p>

<p>Once you have signed up for an account, you will receive an email activation to confirm your email. When you click on the link you will be able to download PyCharm among other JetBrains offerings.</p>

<p>Alternately you can download PyCharm through this <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/">direct link</a>. Be sure to get the Professional Edition, not the more limited Community Edition.</p>

<p>Follow the instructions in the installer.</p>

<p>Once the setup is finished, close PyCharm and move on to the next step.</p>
