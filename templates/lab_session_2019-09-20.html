<p>We'll start working in earnest on data collection through the webapp that we're creating this semester
on 9/27. Until then, we'll continue work on the analysis projects that we started in the Friday session 9/13.</p>
<p>Please continue to meet between now and then with your group to work, coordinating via Slack.</p>
<p>The goal for this guide is to introduce the way that we'll be writing real project code,
which requires good style, documentation, and testing.</p>

<h5>First!</h5>
<p>As always, update your branch from master, per the instructions <a href="lab_session_2019-09-13.html#update_branch_from_master">in the last guide</a>.<p>

<p>You'll probably encounter some merge conflicts between your code and the changes I've made to <code>analysis/analysis.py</code>. Do not fear! Resolve these conflicts
so that you keep both the changes that I've made and your existing changes, in the same manner as in the
<a href='lab_session_2019-09-13.html'>last lab session guide</a>.</p>

<h5>Good Style</h5>
<p>Before you do anything else, make sure the code that you've written so far follows
the lab style guide. We follow <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/">PEP 8</a>, which
is the Python standard style guide (with an exception of limiting line length to 99 chars rather than 79).
The actual style guide is worth a skim at some point in your career, but happily PyCharm
enforces PEP 8 automatically.</p>


<div class="row">
    <div class="col-lg-4">
        <p>Always be aware of the yellow warnings in the right margin and the grey squiggles under your code: 
        <em>do not get in the habit of letting them slide to fix later</em>. These are indications both of
        style problems and of potentially incorrect code. You can mouseover the warnings to see
        the problem, and if you click on the little lightbulb that appears, PyCharm can often fix these style
        problems automatically.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-lg-8">
    <p><img class="img-fluid mb-4 mx-2 mx-lg-0 border float-right" alt=""
            src="./images/session_2019-09-20/0.png" /></p>
    </div>
</div>

<p>Good style may seem merely cosmetic, but it's essential for a large project for everyone to follow
the same style, so that the codebase is consistent and readable.</p>

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-lg-4">
        <p>If everything's good, you should see this green checkmark in the top righthand corner of your editor panel.
    </div>
    <div class="col-lg-8">
    <p><img class="img-fluid mb-4 mx-2 mx-lg-0 border float-right" alt=""
            src="./images/session_2019-09-20/1.png" /></p>
    </div>
</div>

<p>Our CI system checks for adherence to the style guide, and PRs that do not follow the style guide
will be rejected automatically.</p>
<h5>Factor your code out of the common code</h5>
<p>Your group may have written your analysis code directly in the template <code>run_analysis()</code> function.
You should now factor your code out of this function into another function that takes <code>student_data</code>
as an argument, and returns your results rather than printing them.</p>

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-lg-3">
        <p>For example, your analysis might start out looking something like this:</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-lg-9">
        <pre><code class="language-python">def run_analysis():
    csv_path = Path('data', 'rereading_data_2019-09-13.csv')
    student_data = load_data_csv(csv_path)
    total_view_time = 0
    for row in student_data:
        for view_time in row.get('views'):
            total_view_time += view_time
    print(total_view_time)
        </code></pre>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-lg-3">
        <p>Factor your analysis out, so it looks more like this:</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-lg-9">
        <pre><code class="language-python">def compute_total_view_time(student_data):
    total_view_time = 0
    for row in student_data:
        for view_time in row.get('views'):
            total_view_time += view_time
    return total_view_time


def run_analysis():
    csv_path = Path('data', 'rereading_data_2019-09-13.csv')
    student_data = load_data_csv(csv_path)
    total_view_time = compute_total_view_time(student_data)
    print(f'The total view time of all students was {total_view_time}.')</code></pre>
    </div>
</div>

<h5>Document your code</h5>
<p>Now that your analysis is factored out into its own function, give it a docstring.
<a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/">PEP 257</a> is a basic guide to what docstrings are
and how to write a good one. See below for an example.
In a nutshell, a docstring is a block comment that tells the reader:
<ul>
    <li>what the function does</li>
    <li>what its expected inputs are</li>
    <li>what its expected outputs are</li>
</ul>
<p>Keep in mind that the intended audience of your docstring is not you, right now, but rather your 
colleagues (making it easier for them to use your code) and you, three months from now,
when you've completely forgotten that you'd ever even written this thing.</p>
<p>If you start typing three double quotes and hit enter under your function declaration, PyCharm
should automatically create a <code>:param</code> field for each argument to your function
and a <code>:return</code> field. This format is both for clarity and so that tools that automatically
create publishable documentation out of our docstrings can read the inputs and outputs to our
functions. If PyCharm doesn't do this, just follow the format in the example here.</p>

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-lg-3">
        <p>My analysis function now looks like this:</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-lg-9">
        <pre><code class="language-python">def compute_total_view_time(student_data):
    """
    Given a list of student response dicts,
    return the total time (across all users) spent reading the text
    :param student_data: list, student response dicts
    :return: float, the total time all users spent reading the text
    """
    total_view_time = 0
    for row in student_data:
        for view_time in row.get('views'):
            total_view_time += view_time
    return total_view_time</code></pre>
    </div>
</div>

<h5>Test your code</h5>
<p>As a project grows in complexity, code gets refactored and rewritten, and as the number
of connections within the codebase grows, bugs can sneak in. Testing is a way to check
that our codebase remains correct as it evolves. It is also a way to force ourselves
to think about edge cases in our code that we might have not handled.</p>

<p>There are a number of testing tools we'll use throughout the project; here, we introduce
Python's builtin <code>unittest</code> library, a version of which we'll eventually use to test our
Django backend code.</p>

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-lg-3">
        <p>Near the bottom of the <code>analysis.py</code> file you should see a new class <code>TestAnalysisMethods</code>, which subclasses <code>unittest.TestCase</code>. This class is where we define our unit tests for this module.</p>
        <p>You'll also notice that the <code class="text-nowrap language-python">if __name__ == '__main__'</code> block now contains a call to run the tests.</p>
        <p>When this test case is run by the test runner, it first calls the <code>setUp()</code> method, followed by all the tests defined in it, which must have names starting with <code>test_</code>. Properties created within the <code>setUp()</code> method, such as <code>self.test_student_data</code> here, are available to all tests within this class.</p>
        
    </div>

    <div class="col-lg-9">
        <pre><code class="language-python">class TestAnalysisMethods(unittest.TestCase):
def setUp(self):
    test_data_path = Path('data', 'test_data.csv')
    self.test_student_data = load_data_csv(test_data_path)
    self.default_student_data = [  # model default values
        {
            'id': 0,
            'question': '',
            'context': '',
            'response': '',
            'views': [],
            'student_id': 0,
            'scroll_ups': 0,
        }
    ]


def test_compute_total_view_time(self):
    total_view_time = compute_total_view_time(self.test_student_data)
    self.assertEqual(total_view_time, 6.385)

    # check we don't crash on the defaults from the model!
    total_view_time = compute_total_view_time(self.default_student_data)
    self.assertEqual(total_view_time, 0)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    run_analysis()
    unittest.main()  # run the tests</code></pre>
    </div>
</div>




<div class="row">
    <div class="col-lg-5">
        <p>In our <code>setUp()</code> method, we're loading some test data, instead of running our tests
        on the full dataset. This is to avoid coupling our tests to the current state of the actual data, which
        will change as we collect more. The artificial data we sometimes use for tests are called
        'test fixtures'. Note that we're both loading test data from a file (<code>self.test_student_data</code>),
        and creating another dataset in code (<code>self.default_student_data</code>).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="col-lg-7">
        <pre><code class="language-python">def setUp(self):
    test_data_path = Path('data', 'test_data.csv')
    self.test_student_data = load_data_csv(test_data_path)
    self.default_student_data = [  # model default values
        {
            'id': 0,
            'question': '',
            'context': '',
            'response': '',
            'views': [],
            'student_id': 0,
            'scroll_ups': 0,
        }
    ]</code></pre>
    </div>
</div>


<div class="row">
    <div class="col-lg-4">
        <p>Read the test we've already written: <code>test_compute_total_view_time</code>. The main
        feature of this test is that it calls our function on the test data, and asserts that the result
        is equal to our predicted result. You can find a list of assertions that you can make in a Python
        unittest test <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#assert-methods">here</a>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="col-lg-8">
        <pre><code class="language-python">def test_compute_total_view_time(self):
    total_view_time = compute_total_view_time(self.test_student_data)
    self.assertEqual(total_view_time, 6.385)

    # check we don't crash on the defaults from the model!
    total_view_time = compute_total_view_time(self.default_student_data)
    self.assertEqual(total_view_time, 0)</code></pre>
    </div>
</div>

<p>Testing and writing code becomes a valuable feedback cycle; as you get better at writing tests,
your tests will find bugs in your code that you didn't anticipate, which you can fix before they
bite anyone else. In this case, perhaps I wasn't sure that my analysis function handled the default
values, including the empty list for the <code>views</code> field correctly. If this test had caused
a crash, that would be an opportunity to go back and make my code more robust.</p>
<p>Once you understand what's going on in the included test code, write a unit test for your analysis
function. See if you can find an edge case that breaks your function and improve it.</p>

<h5>Make a PR</h5>
<p>Once your code is cleaned up, refactored, documented, and tested, make a PR, so that we can
merge it into the <code>master</code> branch.</p>
